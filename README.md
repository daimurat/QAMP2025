# QAMP2025
## Description
This project aims to design and evaluate multi-agent systems (MAS) that leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents, enhanced with advanced prompt-engineering methods such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to improve quantum code generation. 
Standard LLMs are not trained on specialized scientific software and may hallucinate details, miss domain-specific context, or rely on outdated versions of libraries present in their training data. 
The envisioned tool would provide a conversational interface that fully understands the structure and features of the latest Qiskit releases, helping users with technical questions, code development and execution, debugging, and visualization.
